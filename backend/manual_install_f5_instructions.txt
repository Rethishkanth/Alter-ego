MANUAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR F5-TTS (E: DRIVE)
======================================================
Follow these steps carefully to install F5-TTS locally on your E: drive.

1. SET UP ENVIRONMENT (Open CMD or PowerShell)
-----------------------------------------------
We need to tell HuggingFace to download models to the E: drive to save space on C:.

   setx HF_HOME "E:\huggingface_cache"
   
   (Restart your terminal after running this command to ensure it takes effect)

2. CREATE FOLDER ON E: DRIVE
----------------------------
   E:
   mkdir Project\F5-TTS
   cd Project\F5-TTS

3. DOWNLOAD/INSTALL F5-TTS
--------------------------
We will verify the installation by creating a virtual environment (highly recommended) or installing directly if you prefer.

   git clone https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS.git
   cd F5-TTS
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -e .
   
   # Install PyTorch with CUDA (if you have an NVIDIA GPU, highly recommended for speed)
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   
   (Check your CUDA version and adjust 'cu118' if needed, e.g., 'cu121')

4. DOWNLOAD REFERENCE AUDIO
---------------------------
The backend needs a reference audio file to clone the voice from.
I have created a helper script for you. Run this from your backend folder:

   cd E:\Project\Alter-ego-main\Alter-ego-main\backend
   python utils/download_sample_ref.py

   This will save a 'ref_audio.wav' to 'backend/mock_data'.
   You can replace this file with any 5-10 second clear wav file of the voice you want to clone!

5. RESTART BACKEND
------------------
   Restart your backend server to pick up the new local TTS service.
   pip install soundfile  (if not already installed)

Note: THe first time you run a voice command, it might take a few minutes to download the F5-TTS model weights to E:\huggingface_cache.
