# User Guide: How to Meet Your Alter-Ego

## Step 1: Get Your Data
To communicate with your algorithmic self, you first need to feed it your history.

1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).
2. Deselect all, then scroll down and select **YouTube and YouTube Music**.
3. Click "All YouTube data included" and select **only** "history".
4. Click "Next step" and then "Create export".
5. Wait for the email (usually takes 5-10 minutes for smaller histories).
6. Download the `takeout-....zip` file.

## Step 2: Upload
1. Open the **Alter-Ego** app.
2. Drag and drop your `.zip` file into the upload zone.
3. The system will extract the `watch-history.json` file automatically.

## Step 3: Analysis
The "Brain Building" process happens in stages:
- **Ingestion**: Reading your videos.
- **Sentiment**: analyzing if you watch happy, sad, or intense content.
- **Clustering**: Finding your "Eras" (e.g., "The Sourdough Baking Phase", "The Minecraft Phase").
- **Persona Generation**: Creating a personality that matches your viewing habits.

## Step 4: Chat
- **Voice**: Click the microphone icon to speak to your avatar. It will listen and reply verbally.
- **Text**: Type questions like regular chat.
- **Evidence**: The avatar will often cite specific videos you watched as proof of its claims!
